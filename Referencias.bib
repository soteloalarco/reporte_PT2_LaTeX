abstract = {This chapter introduces the overall content of the book. It contains a brief introduction to the massive Machine-Type Communications (mMTC) category of use cases, spanning a wide range of applications such as smart metering and wearables. When discussing these applications, special attention is given to the service requirements associated with mMTC, for example, in terms of reachability, throughput, and latency. The chapter continues and introduces the concept of the Cellular Internet of Things (CIoT) and the three technologies Extended Coverage Global System for Mobile Communications Internet of Things (EC-GSM-IoT), Narrowband Internet of Things (NB-IoT), and Long-Term Evolution for Machine-Type Communications (LTE-M) that can be said to define this concept. While EC-GSM-IoT and LTE-M are backward compatible solutions based on GSM and LTE, respectively, NB-IoT is a brand new radio access technology. The final part of the chapter looks beyond the set of cellular access technologies and introduces the Low Power Wide Area Network (LPWAN) range of solutions that already have secured a significant footprint in the mMTC market. Unlike the cellular systems, these LPWANs have been designed to operate in licensed exempt spectrum. An initial discussion around the pros and cons of licensed exempt operation is presented to prepare the reader for the final chapters of the book, where a closer look is taken at operation in the unlicensed frequency domain.},

Different other protocols, applications, or infra- structures are still needed for the complete operation of NB-IoT in the field. This book presents the new 5G LTE NB-IoT technology based on Release 15, its protocol stack, architecture, operation, and challenges. The book covers different aspects of NB-IoT and provides necessary details about this technology, while at the same time presents it in simplistic views, as much as possible. This book is one of few books that aims at providing a single-stop shop for one important feature of 5G LTE. The book focuses on pro- viding comprehensive details about a single 5G LTE feature, which is the cellular NB-IoT. NB-IoT is the next wireless technology to enable a world of digital connectivity in home, city, and building. NB-IoT con- nected devices are projected to reach a number of hundreds of thou- sands connected devices per square kilometer.},

abstract = {The aim of this paper is to study how to enlarge the performance gap between non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) and conventional orthogonal multiple access (MA) by applying user pairing. Particularly two user pairing schemes achieving different quality of service (QoS) requirements, namely NOMA with fixed power allocation (F-NOMA) and cognitive radio inspired NOMA (CR-NOMA), are proposed. For F-NOMA, both analytical and numerical results are provided to demonstrate that F-NOMA can offer a larger sum rate than orthogonal MA, and the performance gain of F-NOMA over conventional MA can be further enlarged by selecting users whose channel conditions are more distinctive. For CR-NOMA, the QoS requirements for users with poorer channel conditions can be guaranteed since the transmit power allocated to other users is constrained following the concept of cognitive radio networks. Because of this constraint, CR-NOMA has different behavior compared to F-NOMA, as demonstrated by the developed analytical results.},

The multiple access is a technique used by telecommunication networks to accommodate more users over the single channel. And in these channels, the data is in packet form. As the telecommunication systems evolved i.e. 1G, 2G, 3G, 4G, so did the access techniques used in them. The multiple access techniques (circuit-switching) are mainly of 4 types i.e. FDMA (Frequency Division Multiple Access), TDMA (Time Division Multiple Access), CDMA (Code Division Multiple Access), SDMA (Space Division Multiple Access). And the packet switching used in these circuits are collisionrecovery (ALOHA, Slotted ALOHA, etc.), collision-avoidance (CSMA/CD, CSMA/CA, etc.), collision-free (token bus, token ring).},

abstract = {We use stochastic geometry to analyze the performance of an energy-efficient joint downlink/uplink (UL) radio-frequency (RF) wake-up solution for Internet of Things (IoT) devices over cellular networks. When the IoT device has no data to transmit, it turns its main circuitry completely OFF and switches to a deep sleep mode. The transition back to the active mode is only achieved upon receiving enough power at the device's front end. After wake up, the device initiates regular UL communication with its serving base station (BS). The device experiences a successful wake-up event when the total received power includes a wake-up signal transmitted from its serving BS, and the UL signal-to-interference-and-noise ratio (SINR) is above a predefined threshold. On the other hand, the device experiences a false wake-up event when the wake up is due to received power from neighboring BSs excluding the serving BS. We derive lower and upper bounds for the success and false wake-up probabilities in addition to closed-form expression for the UL SINR coverage probability after successful wake up. We present performance results as a function of various key design parameters and highlight the effectiveness and tradeoffs of RF wake up for IoT devices.},

M2M solutions allow billions of multi-role devices to communicate with each other or with the underlying data transport infrastructure without, or with minimal, human intervention. Current solutions for wireless transmissions originally designed for human-based applications thus require a substantial shift to cope with the capacity issues in managing a huge amount of M2M devices. In this paper, we consider the multiple access techniques as promising solutions to support a large number of devices in cellular systems with limited radio resources. We focus on non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) where, with the aim to increase the channel efficiency, the devices share the same radio resources for their data transmission. This has been shown to provide optimal throughput from an information theoretic point of view. We consider a realistic system model and characterize the system performance in terms of throughput and energy efficiency in an NOMA scenario with a random packet arrival model, where we also derive the stability condition for the system to guarantee the performance.},

abstract = {The recent growth of IoT use-cases in a wide array of industrial, utility and environmental applications has necessitated the need for connectivity solutions with diverse requirements. Connectivity through BLE, Zigbee and 6LoPAN are examples of short-range IoT deployments. But to provide connectivity to a high density of devices over larger coverage areas, Low-Power Wide-Area Network (LPWAN) technologies in both licensed as well as unlicensed bands have been considered. In this paper, we consider modelling the traffic from IoT devices connected through LPWAN technologies. Due to diverse applications of IoT, it is not trivial to have a single traffic model to represent all of them, but the traffic can be broadly classified as either periodic, event-triggered, or a combination of both. We evaluate the performance of LoRaWAN, one such LPWAN technology, in the presence of a hybrid of both traffic types, where the event propagates spatially over time. In a practical deployment of sensor based IoT devices, the devices are usually densely deployed to ensure sufficient {\&} reliable measurement. Thereby, when an event occurs, they exhibit spatial {\&} temporal correlation in their traffic rate due to the natural phenomena of the metric they measure. We use the CMMPP model to represent such characteristic traffic from independent IoT devices triggered by an event. The characteristics of LoRa, the physical layer of LoRaWAN, is abstracted based on required signal strength and interference thresholds for different modulation parameters. Through system simulations, we demonstrate that there is a significant performance hit in LoRaWAN based networks, during the occurrence of events. In particular, using the packet delivery rate (PDR) as the metric, we found that while the system was able to handle regular updates from the devices with a PDR {\textgreater} 80{\%}, event-driven traffic nearly impaired the network causing the PDR to drop below 10{\%}.},

However, the existing Orthogonal Multiple Access (OMA) scheme in NB-IoT cannot provide connectivity for a massive number of MTC devices. In parallel with the development of NB-IoT, Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access (NOMA), introduced for the fifth generation wireless networks, is deemed to significantly improve the network capacity by providing massive connectivity through sharing the same spectral resources. To leverage NOMA in the context of NB-IoT, we propose a power domain NOMA scheme with user clustering for an NB-IoT system. In particular, the MTC devices are assigned to different ranks within the NOMA clusters where they transmit over the same frequency resources. Then, we formulate an optimization problem to maximize the total throughput of the network by optimizing the resource allocation of MTC devices and NOMA clustering while satisfying the transmission power and quality of service requirements. We prove the NP-hardness of the proposed optimization problem. We further design an efficient heuristic algorithm to solve the proposed optimization problem by jointly optimizing NOMA clustering and resource allocation of MTC devices. Furthermore, we prove that the reduced optimization problem of power control is a convex optimization task. Simulation results are presented to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed scheme.},

abstract = {To address the ever increasing high data rate and connectivity requirements in the next generation 5G wireless network, novel radio access technologies (RATs) are actively explored to enhance the system spectral efficiency and connectivity. As a promising RAT for 5G cellular networks, non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) has attracted extensive research attentions. Compared with the orthogonal multiple access (OMA) that has been widely applied in existing wireless communication systems, NOMA possesses the potential to further improve the system spectral efficiency and connectivity capability. This paper develops analytical frameworks for NOMA downlink and uplink multi-cell wireless systems to evaluate the system outage probability and average achievable rate. In the downlink NOMA system, two different NOMA group pairing schemes are considered, based on which theoretical results on outage and achievable data rates are derived. In the uplink NOMA, revised back-off power control scheme is applied, and outage probability and per UE average achievable rate are derived. As wireless networks turn into more and more densely deployed, inter-cell interference has become a dominant capacity limiting factor but has not been addressed in most of the existing NOMA studies. In this paper, a stochastic geometry approach is used to model a dense wireless system, that supports NOMA on both uplink and downlink, based on which analytical results are derived either in pseudo-closed forms or succinct closed forms and are further validated by simulations. Numerical results demonstrate that NOMA can bring considerable system-wide performance gain compared with OMA on both uplink and downlink when properly designed.},

abstract = {Non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) is an essential enabling technology for the fifth generation (5G) wireless networks to meet the heterogeneous demands on low latency, high reliability, massive connectivity, improved fairness, and high throughput. The key idea behind NOMA is to serve multiple users in the same resource block, such as a time slot, subcarrier, or spreading code. The NOMA principle is a general framework, and several recently proposed 5G multiple access schemes can be viewed as special cases. This survey provides an overview of the latest NOMA research and innovations as well as their applications. Thereby, the papers published in this special issue are put into the content of the existing literature. Future research challenges regarding NOMA in 5G and beyond are also discussed.},

abstract = {This paper compares three candidate large-scale propagation path loss models for use over the entire microwave and millimeter-wave (mmWave) radio spectrum: the alpha-beta-gamma (ABG) model, the close-in (CI) free space reference distance model, and the CI model with a frequency-weighted path loss exponent (CIF). Each of these models have been recently studied for use in standards bodies such as 3GPP, and for use in the design of fifth generation (5G) wireless systems in urban macrocell, urban microcell, and indoor office and shopping mall scenarios. Here we compare the accuracy and sensitivity of these models using measured data from 30 propagation measurement datasets from 2 GHz to 73 GHz over distances ranging from 4 m to 1238 m. A series of sensitivity analyses of the three models show that the physically-based two-parameter CI model and three-parameter CIF model offer computational simplicity, have very similar goodness of fit (i.e., the shadow fading standard deviation), exhibit more stable model parameter behavior across frequencies and distances, and yield smaller prediction error in sensitivity testing across distances and frequencies, when compared to the four-parameter ABG model. Results show the CI model with a 1 m close-in reference distance is suitable for outdoor environments, while the CIF model is more appropriate for indoor modeling. The CI and CIF models are easily implemented in existing 3GPP models by making a very subtle modification -- by replacing a floating non-physically based constant with a frequency-dependent constant that represents free space path loss in the first meter of propagation.},

abstract = {Wireless networks are fundamentally limited by the intensity of the received signals and by their interference. Since both of these quantities depend on the spatial location of the nodes, mathematical techniques have been developed in the last decade to provide communication-theoretic results accounting for the network's geometrical configuration. Often, the location of the nodes in the network can be modeled as random, following for example a Poisson point process. In this case, different techniques based on stochastic geometry and the theory of random geometric graphs - including point process theory, percolation theory, and probabilistic combinatorics - have led to results on the connectivity, the capacity, the outage probability, and other fundamental limits of wireless networks. This tutorial article surveys some of these techniques, discusses their application to model wireless networks, and presents some of the main results that have appeared in the literature. It also serves as an introduction to the field for the other papers in this special issue. {\textcopyright} 2009 IEEE.},

abstract = {Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access (OFDMA) as well as other orthogonal multiple access techniques fail to achieve the system capacity limit in the uplink due to the exclusivity in resource allocation. This issue is more prominent when fairness among the users is considered in the system. Current Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access (NOMA) techniques introduce redundancy by coding/spreading to facilitate the users' signals separation at the receiver, which degrade the system spectral efficiency. Hence, in order to achieve higher capacity, more efficient NOMA schemes need to be developed. In this paper, we propose a NOMA scheme for uplink that removes the resource allocation exclusivity and allows more than one user to share the same subcarrier without any coding/spreading redundancy. Joint processing is implemented at the receiver to detect the users' signals. However, to control the receiver complexity, an upper limit on the number of users per subcarrier needs to be imposed. In addition, a novel subcarrier and power allocation algorithm is proposed for the new NOMA scheme that maximizes the users' sum-rate. The link-level performance evaluation has shown that the proposed scheme achieves bit error rate close to the single-user case. Numerical results show that the proposed NOMA scheme can significantly improve the system performance in terms of spectral efficiency and fairness comparing to OFDMA.},

In this Networked Society, every person and every industry will be empowered to reach their full potential. Internet of Things (IoT) technology is a key enabler of this vision by delivering machine-to-machine (M2M) and machine-to-person communications on a massive scale. As shown in Figure 1, Ericsson predicts there will be around 28 billion connected devices by 2021, of which more than 15 billion will be connected M2M and consumer-electronics devices [1]. A large share of these will be applications served by short-range radio technologies such as Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, while a significant proportion will be enabled by wide area networks (WANs) that are primarily facilitated by cellular networks. THE NEW IOT LANDSCAPE The IoT revolution offers huge potential value in terms of improved efficiency, sustainability and safety for industry and society. Analysts predict that the total added value of the IoT will be USD 1.9 trillion by 2020 [2]. The variety of applications and solutions designed for individuals, business and industry is spurring the rapid expansion of the IoT market. The IoT is playing a major role across a variety of vertical sectors, generating cost savings, new revenue streams and other benefits. Each IoT application needs a clear value proposition and business logic in line with the prevailing ecosystem, business models and value chains of the various stakeholders. For all applications, solutions need to be integrated on platforms that can scale and handle millions of devices efficiently. Business processes for administration, provisioning and charging will have to be streamlined to minimize costs and enhance the business case. As they are largely responsible for wireless connectivity on a global scale, operators are in an excellent position to capture a share of the added value generated by the emerging IoT market. The size of this share will depend on the role that operators adopt in the value chain. This could range from being a straightforward connectivity provider (monetizing connectivity in new ways), all the way to being an end-to-end solution provider of turnkey solutions to vertical markets [3].},

abstract = {The fifth generation of mobile technology (5G) is positioned to address the demands and business contexts of 2020 and beyond. It is expected to enable a fully mobile and connected society and to empower socio-economic transformations in countless ways many of which are unimagined today, including those for productivity, sustainability and well-being. The demands of a fully mobile and connected society are characterized by the tremendous growth in connectivity and density/volume of traffic, the required multi-layer densification in enabling this, and the broad range of use cases and business models expected. Therefore, in 5G, there is a need to push the envelope of performance to provide, where needed, for example, much greater throughput, much lower latency, ultra-high reliability, much higher connectivity density, and higher mobility range. This enhanced performance is expected to be provided along with the capability to control a highly heterogeneous environment, and capability to, among others, ensure security and trust, identity, and privacy. While extending the performance envelope of mobile networks, 5G should include by design embedded flexibility to optimize the network usage, while accommodating a wide range of use cases, business and partnership models. The 5G architecture should include modular network functions that could be deployed and scaled on demand, to accommodate various use cases in an agile and cost efficient manner. In 5G, NGMN anticipates the need for new radio interface(s) driven by use of higher frequencies, specific use cases such as Internet of Things (IoT) or specific capabilities (e.g., lower latency), which goes beyond what 4G and its enhancements can support. However, 5G is not only about the development of a new radio interface. NGMN envisions 5G as an end-to-end system that includes all aspects of the network, with a design that achieves a high level of convergence and leverages today's access mechanisms (and their evolution), including fixed, and also any new ones in the future. 5G will operate in a highly heterogeneous environment characterized by the existence of multiple types of access technologies, multi-layer networks, multiple types of devices, multiple types of user interactions, etc. In such an environment, there is a fundamental need for 5G to achieve seamless and consistent user experience across time and space. Business orientation and economic incentives with foundational shift in cost, energy and operational efficiency should make 5G feasible and sustainable. 5G should also enable value creation towards customers and partners through the definition and exposure of capabilities that enhance today's overall service delivery. Enabling 5G use cases and business models require the allocation of additional spectrum for mobile broadband and needs to be supported by flexible spectrum management capabilities. In addition, an IPR eco-system needs to be developed to further enable innovation and unlock the potential associated with some of the use cases described in this paper. NGMN and other stakeholders/partners will work together towards delivering globally and commercially available 5G solutions by 2020. This process will require a process of collaboration in the industry through existing standards development organizations (SDOs), or potentially new collaboration forms like open source.},

However, neither 1) nor 2) are true for M2M traffic in cellular networks. This paper analyses M2M traffic with variable arrival rate under the assumption that the LTE network has limited resources. The results showcase the characteristics of the M2M traffic in a more realistic manner pinpointing the differences from the standard traffic in cellular network. They reveal that the traffic is not self-similar, but only for large number of machines.

abstract = {Machine-to-machine (M2M) or Machine-type Communication (MTC) is expected to significantly increase in future wireless networks. It exhibits considerably different traffic patterns than human-type communication, thus, claims for new traffic models and simulation scenarios. The challenge in designing such models is not only to accurately capture the behavior of single MTC devices but also to handle their enormous amount (e.g., up to 30 000 devices per cell) and their coordinated behavior. Source traffic models (i.e., each device is modeled as autonomous entity) are generally desirable for their precision and flexibility. However, their complexity is in general growing quadratically with the number of devices. Aggregated traffic models (i.e., all device are summarized to one stream) are far less precise but their complexity is mainly independent of the number of devices. In this work we propose an approach which is combining the advantages of both modeling paradigms, namely, the Coupled Markov Modulated Poisson Processes (CMMPP) framework. It demonstrates the feasibility of source traffic modeling for MTC, being enabled by only linearly growing complexity. Compared to aggregated MTC traffic models, such as proposed by 3GPP TR37.868, CMMPP allows for enhanced accuracy and flexibility at the cost of moderate computational complexity. {\textcopyright} VDE Verlag GMBH.},
